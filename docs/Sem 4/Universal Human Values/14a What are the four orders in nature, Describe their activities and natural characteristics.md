---

#### 1. Physical Order

- **Activities:**
  - Involves elements like air, water, metal, and other physical substances essential for sustaining life and ecological balance.
- **Natural Characteristics:**
  - Provides the foundation for life by supporting biological processes, regulating climate, and serving as essential resources for all living organisms.

#### 2. Bio Order

- **Activities:**
  - Encompasses grass, plants, trees, and other flora that play a vital role in oxygen production, food chains, and ecosystem stability.
- **Natural Characteristics:**
  - Sustain biodiversity, provide habitats for various species, contribute to soil fertility, and participate in nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration.

#### 3. Animal Order

- **Activities:**
  - Includes animals and birds that interact with plants, contribute to pollination, seed dispersal, and nutrient recycling, and play crucial roles in maintaining ecological balance.
- **Natural Characteristics:**
  - Contribute to the food web, regulate populations of other species, and support ecosystem services such as pest control and seed dispersal.

#### 4. Human Order

- **Activities:**
  - Involves human beings who have the capacity for self-awareness, creativity, and conscious decision-making, influencing the environment and other orders through their actions.
- **Natural Characteristics:**
