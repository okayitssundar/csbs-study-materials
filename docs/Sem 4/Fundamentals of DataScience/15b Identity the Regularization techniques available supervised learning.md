### 1. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)

- **Description:** Ridge regression adds a penalty term to the loss function that penalizes large coefficients, encouraging smaller coefficient values.
- **Purpose:** Helps prevent overfitting by reducing the impact of irrelevant features in the model.
- **Formula:** Minimizes the sum of squared coefficients, balancing between fitting the data and keeping coefficients small.

### 2. LASSO Regression (L1 Regularization)

- **Description:** LASSO regression imposes an L1 penalty on the coefficients, leading to sparse models with some coefficients set to zero.
- **Purpose:** Promotes feature selection by shrinking less important features to zero, simplifying the model.
- **Formula:** Minimizes the sum of absolute coefficients, encouraging sparsity in the model.

### 3. Elastic Net Regularization

- **Description:** Elastic Net combines L1 (LASSO) and L2 (Ridge) penalties to address the limitations of each regularization technique.
- **Purpose:** Balances between feature selection (L1) and coefficient shrinkage (L2) for improved model performance.
- **Formula:** Combines the penalties of Ridge and LASSO regression to achieve a compromise between sparsity and coefficient size.

### 4. Dropout Regularization (Neural Networks)

- **Description:** Dropout is a technique used in neural networks where random neurons are dropped out during training to prevent overfitting.
- **Purpose:** Improves generalization by forcing the network to learn redundant representations and reduces co-adaptation of neurons.
- **Implementation:** During training, a fraction of neurons are randomly set to zero, and the remaining neurons are scaled by the dropout rate.

### 5. Early Stopping

- **Description:** Early stopping is a regularization technique that stops training the model when the validation error starts to increase.
- **Purpose:** Prevents overfitting by halting the training process before the model starts to memorize the training data.
- **Implementation:** Monitors the validation error during training and stops when it begins to rise, indicating overfitting.

Regularization techniques are essential in supervised learning to prevent overfitting, improve model generalization, and enhance performance on unseen data. Each regularization method offers unique advantages and is applied based on the specific requirements of the dataset and model being used.
