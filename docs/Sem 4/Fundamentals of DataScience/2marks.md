1. **Define Data Science:** Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business, combining principles from mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large datasets.

2. **Differentiate between Populations and Samples of Big Data:**

   - **Population:** Represents the entire dataset of interest.
   - **Sample:** Subset of the population used for analysis to draw conclusions about the entire dataset.

3. **Types of Descriptive Statistics:**

   - Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
   - Measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation)
   - Frequency distributions
   - Correlation analysis

4. **Languages used for Data Science:**

   - Python
   - R
   - SQL
   - Java
   - Scala

5. **Formula for calculating the Z-Score:**

   - Z-Score = (X - μ) / σ, where X is the data point, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.

6. **Importance of Scoring:** Scoring helps evaluate and rank data points based on predefined criteria, aiding decision-making and identifying patterns or outliers in the data.

7. **Advantages of Data Visualization:**

   - Simplifies complex data
   - Identifies trends and patterns
   - Enhances understanding and communication of insights
   - Supports decision-making
   - Enables quick identification of outliers or anomalies

8. **Importance of Baseline Modeling:** Baseline modeling provides a benchmark for comparing the performance of more complex models, helping assess the effectiveness of advanced algorithms.

9. **Difference between Overfitting and Underfitting:**

   - **Overfitting:** Model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, leading to poor generalization on unseen data.
   - **Underfitting:** Model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in low accuracy on both training and test data.

10. **Importance of Logistic Regression:** Logistic regression is essential for binary classification problems, predicting the probability of an event occurring, making it valuable in areas like risk assessment, marketing analytics, and healthcare outcomes prediction.
