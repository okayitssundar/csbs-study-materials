Strict Two-Phase Locking (Strict 2PL) and Rigorous Two-Phase Locking (Rigorous 2PL) are variations of the Two-Phase Locking (2PL) protocol, each with its own set of rules for managing concurrent transactions in a database system. Let's compare them and explain how they work differently, using an example to illustrate the contrast.

### Strict Two-Phase Locking (Strict 2PL):

In Strict 2PL, a transaction holds all its locks until it reaches its commit point. No locks are released until the transaction completes, ensuring that no other transaction can access the locked data until the holding transaction either commits or aborts.

**Example:**

Consider two transactions, T1 and T2, operating on a bank database:

- T1: Transfer $100 from Account A to Account B.
- T2: Check the balance of Account A.

**Operation of Strict 2PL:**

1. **Growing Phase:**

   - T1 acquires locks on Account A and Account B during the transfer operation.
   - T2 waits for T1 to release the lock on Account A.

2. **Commit Phase:**
   - T1 completes the transfer successfully and releases all locks.
   - T2 acquires the lock on Account A and checks the balance.

### Rigorous Two-Phase Locking (Rigorous 2PL):

Rigorous 2PL extends the concept of Strict 2PL by also requiring that all locks held by a transaction must be released after the transaction has committed or aborted, regardless of whether the transaction commits or aborts.

**Example:**

Consider the same two transactions, T1 and T2, operating on the bank database:

**Operation of Rigorous 2PL:**

1. **Growing Phase:**

   - T1 acquires locks on Account A and Account B during the transfer operation.
   - T2 waits for T1 to release the lock on Account A.

2. **Commit Phase:**
   - T1 completes the transfer successfully and releases all locks.
   - Even though T1 commits, it must release all locks it held, including those on Account A.

### Contrast:

- **Lock Release:** In Strict 2PL, locks are released only after a transaction commits, whereas in Rigorous 2PL, locks are released after a transaction commits or aborts.
- **Concurrency:** Strict 2PL may lead to more contention for locks, potentially reducing concurrency. Rigorous 2PL allows other transactions to access the locked data once a transaction commits or aborts, increasing concurrency.

- **Commit Dependency:** In Strict 2PL, transactions can be dependent on each other until they commit. In Rigorous 2PL, transactions are less dependent on each other as they release locks after committing or aborting.

### Conclusion:

While both Strict 2PL and Rigorous 2PL ensure serializability and prevent data anomalies, they differ in the timing of lock release and their impact on concurrency. The choice between these protocols depends on factors such as the application requirements, concurrency needs, and performance considerations.
