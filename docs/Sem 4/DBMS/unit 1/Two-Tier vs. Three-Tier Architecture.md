**Two-Tier Architecture:**

1. **Client Tier (Presentation Tier):**

   - User Interface (UI): Handles user interaction.
   - Presentation Logic: Basic processing of user inputs.

2. **Server Tier (Data Tier):**
   - Database Server: Stores and manages data.
   - Data Processing Logic: Includes database operations.

![Three-Tier Architecture](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231101172935/Introduction-of-3-Tier-Architecture-in-DBMS.webp)

**Three-Tier Architecture:**

1. **Client Tier (Presentation Tier):**

   - User Interface (UI): Interface for user interaction.
   - Presentation Logic: Handling of user input and basic processing.

2. **Application Tier (Logic Tier):**

   - Business Logic: Implements business rules and logic.
   - Process Management: Manages data processing.

3. **Data Tier (Data Tier):**
   - Database Server: Stores and manages data.
   - Data Storage: Persistent storage of application data.

**Distinctive Features:**

- **Two-Tier Architecture:**

  - Simple and straightforward.
  - Direct communication between client and server.
  - Client handles most of the processing.
  - Scalability and maintenance challenges.

- **Three-Tier Architecture:**
  - Separation of concerns: UI, Logic, and Data.
  - Better scalability and maintainability.
  - Improved security by hiding data access details.
  - Greater flexibility for updates and modifications.

**Components:**

- **Two-Tier Architecture:**

  - Client UI.
  - Presentation Logic.
  - Database Server.
  - Data Processing Logic.

- **Three-Tier Architecture:**
  - Client UI.
  - Presentation Logic.
  - Business Logic.
  - Data Storage.
  - Process Management.
